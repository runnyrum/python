python
======

some python scripts I dabbled with

copyPLtoDir.py
I usually listen to my songs on windows media player and keep updating the playlist based on my mood. On some occasions like travel, etc I switch to my phone only to find my phone playlist outdated. This script copies the entire list of songs from all over my laptop that are in my playlist to one location [can be in any drive accessible to script].

lyrics.py
I listen to songs of multiple languages and I cant always piece out the lyrics. This script does some basic web scraping from some popular websites to list out the lyrics.
Improvements:
Can make it into a full fledged android music listening app so that I dont have to manually run the script every time.
Can add translation so that I can understand the lyrics as well.

moviegenre.py
Creates folders as per IMDb movie genres and moves the movies into that. So that I know which movie to watch without having to see the trailer.
